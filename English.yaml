    It is no exaggeration to say that Budapest’s present-day cityscape took shape in the last quarter of the nineteenth century. The number of buildings in the Hungarian capital practically doubled between 1869 and 1894. The Parliament Building, the Grand Boulevard, Andrássy Avenue, the Opera House, the Elisabeth and Margaret Bridges, and the Nyugati (Western) railway station (designed by the office of Gustave Eiffel) were among the monuments that arose during this period.
- Key: second
  Value: |
    Continental Europe’s first underground railway line was inaugurated in 1896, within the framework of the millennium celebrations of the Magyars’ settlement of the Carpathian Basin. Likewise a result of this building fever was the New York Palace (1894), designed by architect Alajos Hauszmann, who had directed the expansion of the Buda Castle. He was given free budgetary rein for the palace project by the principal sponsor, an American insurance company. Indeed, the café, the most sumptuous part of this eclectic building, was constructed almost solely of enduring materials, not least marble and bronze, with frescoes ornamenting the ceiling.

  Value: |
    At the start of the twentieth century the New York Café assumed a literary ambiance, thanks in no small part to the literature-loving head waiters, who provided poor writers with stationery, writing utensils, and modest sums of credit. The first issues of Nyugat (West), which launched in 1908 and became the era’s most seminal literary journal, were practically born on its marble tables. The café was also popular with others in the arts, including actors, composers, and painters, and may be considered the cradle of Hungarian cinema. It was here that Hungary’s first cinema journals saw the light of day; here, that silent film star Vilma Bánky signed her first contract; and here, that Mihály Kertész—later known as Michael Curtiz, director of Casablanca—announced that he was moving abroad.

    Open day and night, this institution—whose front-door key, so legend has it, was once thrown into the Danube—was a place where one could not only write in peace but also, when need be, catch a bit of shut-eye on a table. The World Wars put a temporary end to the flourishing café, which closed its doors in 1916 for the first time, reviving for a while in the 1930s. From 1954 on it reopened again and again under different names and different management.

    János Fabula, a waiter at the New York Café, was found dead yesterday morning.
    The young man, considered by many to have been the right-hand man to Jean, the head waiter, suffered from no chronic illness. Police <b>suspect poisoning</b>. The only witness to the tragic event is his <b>half-eaten breakfast</b>. János Fabula is survived by his older sister, Malvin.

    Our waiter was usually so absorbed in conjuring up poems in his head that he missed his underground stop at Oktogon, realizing his mistake only at Vörösmarty Square. On this day, as at other such times, he would arrive late at work, risking the wrath of Jean, the headwaiter.

    Those taking their evening walk along the Danube promenade noticed the presence of a dazed woman. She stood motionless, staring straight ahead, before walking into the Danube and submerging. Fortunately for her, a police officer patrolling nearby ran up and pulled her to the riverbank. The lady, Malvin Fabula—who, it turned out, is the governess of a family famed for its match factory—was taken straight to the asylum in Buda’s Lipótmező neighborhood, where she was subjected to shock therapy.

    However, Malvin had not anticipated that Osvát would refuse his breakfast, which was finally consumed by her hungry brother, thus condemning him to death. His poor big sister went irrevocably mad over this.

  Value: |
    In the nineteenth century, white phosphorus, used in match manufacturing, was a popular means of murder and, indeed, suicide. Among other things, a victim’s vomit, with its eerie greenish glow, suggested phosphorus poisoning. Many people had to die before white phosphorus was replaced on match heads by the harmless red phosphorus.
- Key: epilogue_1
  Value: |
    Even though our story is fiction, punctuated with exaggerations characteristic of crime stories, it expresses, like a distorting mirror, an essential truth about Budapest at the beginning of the twentieth century: at the time, literature was a deadly serious affair. Nyugat managed to become both the workshop and the forum of modern Hungarian literature for thirty-three years, thanks to the high standards of editors such as Osvát and to the intellectually fertile atmosphere of literary cafés, especially the New York Café. As Ede the butler puts it in Hungarian writer Sándor Márai's novel Sinbad Comes Home, “A coffeehouse is that singular environment that is not at all good for health in a medical or athletic sense, but that is uniquely useful in a literary sense, where writers are somewhat protected from the temptations of the world, from the red tape of bureaucracy, and from the brutality of money. Nicotine and coffee wear out their lungs and hearts, but their minds flourish, and that is more important."
- Key: epilogue_2
  Value: |
    Damaged in World War II, the New York Café closed its doors in 1947. It became a sporting goods store for a while, and then a travel agency before returning to its vocation as a café in 1954, under the name Hungária. Its original name was restored in 2006, with the New York Café open in all its former glory ever since. If you happen to be in Budapest, by all means stop in. You have nothing to fear: the Little Literary is long gone from the menu.
